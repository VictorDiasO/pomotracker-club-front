Yesterday I started to install a Database to run only on the client-side and it went very wrong.

I installed pouchDb and I saw some errors on my console, but I just ignore them thinking that it was fine and finished to implement the functionalities that I needed. Ok, until here it was fine.

Then those errors started to bother me, so I started to look for solutions on ChatGPT hahaha, nothing was helping. I changed my node version uncontable times, validated my dependencies more times that I can count too and nothing worked. Then I thought: "Ok, I will ignore this, maybe it will not affect anything else.".
Yep, a very "Junior" mind hahaha.

Then I just pushed the changes and continue to work. After a couple of minutes Vercel sended me an email saying that they got an error while building the application for deployment.

I come back to search for solutions and find nothing. So today, after 24 hours struggling with this error in my mind I decided to change and use Dexie, what turns out to be a very good solution for my problem, maybe even better.

So todays learning is: Never, ever ignore text when it comes to logs! hahaha.
