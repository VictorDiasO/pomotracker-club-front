Ok, I've decided to make a product from this software right here.
I think it will be fun to use this software as a way to understand more about Marketing and even about creating products in general.

So thinking about that I started to search for stuff that my application dont have but could have, and a good way to do that is basically just looking into our competitors. So I started to use AI to help me search for competitors and I found some really good examples. Then I started to note it down, all the fun stuff that I saw on my competitors I started to take notes on and save it in my "Competitors" file, so I can look into it to decide my next steps.

The other thing that I needed to understand was how big this market is, and where it is big. So I used Bard from Google to help me out with those data (I didn't made any research about this data because for now I dont really care if its completely right, but seems right to me hahaha).
Using Bard I got the following answer to the question "How big is the Pomodoro timers consumption around the world?", the answer:
- "The global market for Pomodoro timers is estimated to be worth USD 1.2 billion in 2023, and is projected to reach USD 2.5 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 15.2% during the forecast period."

- "The growing popularity of the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, is driving the growth of the market. The Pomodoro Technique is used by students, professionals, and entrepreneurs around the world to improve their focus and productivity."

- "The market is segmented by type, distribution channel, and application. By type, the market is segmented into analog timers, digital timers, and mobile apps. By distribution channel, the market is segmented into online and offline. By application, the market is segmented into students, professionals, and entrepreneurs."

- "Geographically, the market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is the largest market for Pomodoro timers, followed by Europe and Asia Pacific. The growth in the North American market is attributed to the increasing adoption of the Pomodoro Technique among students and professionals. The growth in the European market is attributed to the rising awareness of the benefits of the Pomodoro Technique and the growing availability of Pomodoro timers. The growth in the Asia Pacific market is attributed to the increasing urbanization and the growing number of students and professionals."

"Here are some of the key factors driving the growth of the Pomodoro timers market:
- Increasing popularity of the Pomodoro Technique
- Growing demand for time management tools
- Rising awareness of the benefits of the Pomodoro Technique
- Increasing disposable income
- Growing availability of Pomodoro timers"

"However, the market also faces some challenges, such as:
- Competition from other time management tools
- Lack of awareness about the Pomodoro Technique in some emerging markets
Overall, the market for Pomodoro timers is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, driven by the increasing popularity of the Pomodoro Technique and the rising demand for time management tools.""

So, how you can see we have a very good answer to this question right here, and based on this data we can get to the following understanding:
- if we have only 0.01% of the market, our revenue could be: $160.000/yearly.
- Our main challenges are: Make more people aware of the Pomodoro technique, and extinguish our competitors hahaha.
To extinguish our competitors we need some simple things, such as: Make our UI/UX better than their, make our application cover the most important integrations with other apps, create a way to shift our application into a platform where people can create their own solutions for their specific needs (like Notion did).
