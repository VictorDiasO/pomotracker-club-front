So I had started to work on a new feature that is basically the UI of the tasks, and it got funny... I started to see some building times that were not good.
The application have only 1 screen so doesn't make sense to wait 1000ms for the UI to render, right?
So today I will just start to optimize my website and make it run faster, better and smother.
