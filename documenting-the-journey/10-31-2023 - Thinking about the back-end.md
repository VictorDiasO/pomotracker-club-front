I started to look and search ways to design the back-end architecture for this application... but as I writed on README, this project have the main purpose of work as a company.

What "Work as a company" means?
Easy, work as a company is basically focus on "profit"/scale. Focus in achieve the most number of users and features without having to worry too much about costs... so I need to start from a MVP (Minimal Viable Product), and in this case my budget for this MVP is $0 or less hahahaha.

I forgot the idea of creating a complex back-end for this application, and maybe we can use the "/api" route from NextJS instead for the MVP. With this simple approach we can validate the idea, put people to use it and etc.

But what I've "decided" about the back-end is:
- It will be made using NestJS;
- I will use a Relational database
- I will TRY to use open source solutions to host my database (it depends on the prices hahaha).

The architecture of the back-end application will be very simple, maybe I wont need to use a Load Balancer or something similar because I have other ideas to make the requests cheap for our pocket hahahaha.
