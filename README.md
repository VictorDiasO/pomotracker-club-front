This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

WARNING: This project is for study, so im focusing on create and deploy it asap, so Pomotracker-club will evolve by the time and may never be finished because I will always want to add something :D.
And I will be going through a hard (and the normal) way at software development, that will be:
- Create this System as fast as possible
- Deploying in a poorly way
- Refactoring small parts of the system
- Deploying things in a reasonable way
- Improving the performance of the system as much as possible
- Dockerizing this system so it can be deployed "almost anywhere"
- Adding tests on front-end (Seems a really funny thing to try here)
- Make the front end scalable
- Deploying it in a reasonable way again and again
...

Must Have:
- [x] Timers
- [x] Editing Timers
- [ ] Have sounds to the beggining and ending of the timers.
- [ ] Reset The Timer After Start (A button to reset the timer appears only after the timer is started)
- [ ] A list of ideas on what to do in Short Breaks and Long Breaks;
- [ ] CRUD of Tasks to Focus on

Would be Nice to have:
- [ ] Reports of focus and Chill time (plus each task you spend more and less pomodoros in)
- [ ] Ranking system to increase your motivation if you are competitive
- [ ] When its time to a long break, you can write a resume in 3 minutes of what you did or where did you stoped at to make easier your come back after a long break.
- [ ] All your resumes would be stored (if you want) so someday you can visualize them as a diary of work, study, research, etc.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
