They are very beautiful and simple. But maybe too much options for personalization.
They enable users to change the background and have some enviroments such as Natura, Home, and "Focus room". For each one of these the user can edit some stuff such as the background.
And have some quotes too, I didnt find them on the app yet but I already thought about it on the past.
Anndd they enable you to connect your own spotiffy account.
Fullscreen mode is cool too.
The streak stuff is fun, we can use it to create a global ranking system, or enable the user to use this streaks as a "currency" to buy some "PRO" things on the application (if we decide to make it a real product hahaha).

This one is cool too, but what made me save it here is their Options Menu, seems very cool, pretty and simple.

This one enables you to upload your own backgroud, very cool too. Maybe I can have some pre-set background images with very high resolution AND enable the users to upload their own too.

Very cool stuff, what make me save it here is the cat. They put a cat above your timer, maybe I can create some options for pets and enable paid users to make their own pets with pre-set parts of pets, I think it would be very funny and shareble.

I dont have any interest in applying this to anything on this app for now. But seems cool to save it here, because its another application that on the future I can make better and make it a whole new application and connect my various applications between them.

I liked this one because of the "blocklist" feature. Seems very cool.
