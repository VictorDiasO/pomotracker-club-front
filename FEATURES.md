# Features Docs

## Tasks to Focus On
It's basically a CRUD, and to create a new task you just need to fill this fields:
- Task Name / Title
- (Only if you know how much time you want to focus on) Set the quantity of pomodoro timers need to finish this task.

Then I want to create a sub-tasks system, sometimes we need to develop some feature but there are a lot of other "sub-features" that we need to focus on, so I want the possibility to create and manage sub-tasks.
